The AutocadUpLoad add-in for excel allows you to download a short statement from a commercial offer. 

It consists of a standard add-in class in which variables of the active application, workbook, and worksheet are aggregated. It also contains methods subscribed to standard sheet events. 

The panel class contains methods subscribed to interface element events and private methods that are called by them. 

The "Commands" file contains a small hierarchy of classes-functors that highlight the cells involved in the program on the sheet. Their formatting can be reset to the previous state. 

The "Loaders" file contains a class in which the logic of creating an excel file for unloading a statement is encapsulated. The statement consists of a column of articles, titles and pictures.
